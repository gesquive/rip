# rip

Sends a text file line by line to a remote host/port.


### Why?
 - Because bash has the ability to send data directly to a port, but other shell's and OSs do not.
 - Because netcat is sometimes blocked because it is a "hacking" tool.
 - Because sometimes you need to throttle a data streem

## Installing

### Compile
This project requires go 1.6+ to compile. Just run `go get -u github.com/gesquive/rip` and the executable should be built for you automatically in your `$GOPATH`.

Optionally you can run `make install` to build and copy the executable to `/usr/local/bin/` with correct permissions.

### Download
Alternately, you can download the latest release for your platform from [github](https://github.com/gesquive/rip/releases).

Once you have an executable, make sure to copy it somewhere on your path like `/usr/local/bin` or `C:/Program Files/`.
If on a \*nix/mac system, make sure to run `chmod +x /path/to/rip`.
